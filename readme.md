# NSS WYSIWYG Exercise, V2 :: jQuery Version

### Project Description 

Five famous people, [Barack Obama, Daenerys Targaryen, Meryl Streep, Kate McKinnon, Bernie Sanders], are hard-coded into an Object Array along with required attributes: `title`, `name`, `bio`, `lifespan`, as well as an image to be displayed. The contents of the array are written dynamically to the DOM using `jQuery`. If a viewer/user clicks on the *card* for one of these Famous People, the card border displays in `dotted red`, and the user has opportunity to edit the Person's biography. 

This exercise was first written using only vanilla `JavaScript`; that version can be seen [here](https://github.com/SMITHsharon/wysiwyg) The purpose of this assignment was to reproduce its functionality using `jQuery` after a fast summary overview of JQuery syntax and capabilities.
